# rtemps 0.2.0

A simple R package that I created in order to have some quick templates with code examples that would be beneficial especially for beginners.
I checked the `rmdformats` package but the templates it generates are empty, so this makes users read documentation, etc. so it felt not so much proper for a beginner who wants to have everything in one place (citing, links, references, tables, plots, footnotes, styling with css, etc.).
I feel this can be useful to some people (through trivial and unnecessary to others) and that's why I submit it to CRAN. No hearts are broken if it does not get accepted :)
I will also ask to have the repo referred to from the R Markdown documentation - that would be nice I think (or maybe even the `bookdown` documentation since one of the themes is based on that).
